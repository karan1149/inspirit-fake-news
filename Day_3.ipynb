We can use the approach from yesterday where we extract counts from the description for particular keywords and use these as features, but this would require us to manually select features that we think are important. What if our model automatically collected all of the most important keywords and added their counts for each website description to our feature vector? Our model could then learn feature weights for these words to help us correctly classify news websites.\n",

Use the helper function *get_description_from_html* defined above to extract all of the descriptions for the websites in the training data.

    "Not too much to see here–each word vector is a vector of 300 numbers, and it's hard to interpret them from looking at the numbers. Remember that the important property of word vectors is that words with similar meaning have similar word vectors. The magic happens when we compare word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have set up a demo where we compare the word vectors for two words using a comparison metric known as cosine similarity. Intuitively, cosine similarity measures the extent to which two vectors point in the same direction. You might be familiar with the fact that the cosine similarity between two vectors is the same as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors–ranging between -1 and 1. -1 means that two vectors are facing opposite directions, 0 means that they are perpindicular, and 1 means that they are facing the same direction. \n",

    "Try running the below to compare the vectors for \"good\" and \"great\", and then try other words, like \"planet\" (~10 minutes). What do you notice that's expected and unexpected?"

    "We can see that word embeddings appear to capture the meaning of different words–when two words are similar, the cosine similarity score is higher, and when two words are dissimilar, the cosine similarity score is lower.\n",

    "Word vectors are created by going over a large body of text (the vectors you are using were trained on Wikipedia in part) and noticing which words tend to occur near each-other. If word A tends to co-occur with similar words as word B, then the word vectors for words A and B are mathematically constrained to be similar. If you want to learn more about an algorithm for training word vectors, see this [helpful introduction to word2vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa).\n",

Averaging word vectors produces a natural way to produce vectors for sentences and other collections of words, and this is the approach we will use.\n",
